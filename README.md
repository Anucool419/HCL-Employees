1. For each active customer, we are to estimate the total monetary amount the customer spends in the next 30 days (after the cutoff dates) based on his/her previous purchases. 
The features such as historical transaction behavior, category preferences etc. were taken into consideration before preparing a prediction model.
The SQL approach and the traditional python approach was made to find the prediction amount of the customer.
Appropriate regression metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),R^2 were used in this prediction model.

2. We had obtained a dataset from public sources which was about the sales on online retail stores. Our objective was to find the short-term CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) over a defined horizon.
The data includes a transaction-level data. Also, each customer has multiple transactions over time and each of them has an individual timestamp of the purchase. Also it has enough information to compute the monetary value. The customers range all the way from Australia, UK to France, Germany.
Dataset contains more that 15000 transactions and is done on various fields. With all these, we were able to clean off the data and segregated them into bad records and clean records and regression models were applied based on the same.
